# MonsterHunterTalismanManager
Monster Hunter is a popular game where one collects monster parts and creates armor, weapons, and decorations to make them a more effective hunter.
This program is intended to store the talismans that you create in any Monster Hunter game so that it is much easier to manage which talismans are created, removed, and determine which skills are duplicates.
In order to run this program, you need to install MySQL or another SQL editor and set your connection string in the DatabaseConnection.java file.
